\chapter{\abstractname}

All PhD theses must have two scientific summaries/abstracts:
One in Norwegian and one in English (it can be the same text).
The summaries/abstracts should be up to two pages (600--1200 words) and must be included in the thesis at the time of submission.
If you need assistance for the Norwegian summary, contact your supervisor/research group.
As a last resort, you could use Semantix Translations (\url{www.semantix.no}).
Please contact Semantix in order to get a quote.

Automatic \enquote{quotation marks} and cross-references are handled correctly for the specified language.
