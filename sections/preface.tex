\chapter{Preface}
This thesis is submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of \emph{Philosophiae Doctor} at \sorbonne.
The research presented here was conducted at the \pasteur, under the supervision of Dr. Rayan Chikhi and Dr. Yoann Dufresne.
This work was supported by the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under the Marie Skłodowska-Curie grant agreement No \num{956229} (+Panagaia +Pasteur + INCEPTION).

The thesis is a collection of the different projects I worked on during my stay at \pasteur. I begin with an small foreword of the research output of my PhD, and a gentle introduction of the scientific concepts needed to understand the rest of the manuscript. In the first section I present the published paper I am first author of, together with other unpublished work I lead or independently developed. In the second section I present other results of my scientific production, with novel elaboration of the work that appeared in the other papers I am co-author and presentation of projects that have or will be submitted to revision.
The common theme is pangenomics and computational methods used to generate and use such models to infer relevant information.  
This essay ends with a chapter showcasing future perspectives and conclusions.
