It can be used to compare genomes on chromosome level or to zoom in on any selected region. In addition, plotsr can augment the visualization with regional identifiers (e.g. genes or genomic markers) or histogram tracks for continuous features (e.g. GC content or polymorphism density).plotsr is implemented as a python package and uses the standard matplotlib library for plotting.

abstract={Genomic differences range from single nucleotide differences to complex structural variations. Current methods typically annotate sequence differences ranging from SNPs to large indels accurately but do not unravel the full complexity of structural rearrangements, including inversions, translocations, and duplications, where highly similar sequence changes in location, orientation, or copy number. Here, we present SyRI, a pairwise whole-genome comparison tool for chromosome-level assemblies. SyRI starts by finding rearranged regions and then searches for differences in the sequences, which are distinguished for residing in syntenic or rearranged regions. This distinction is important as rearranged regions are inherited differently compared to syntenic regions.},
