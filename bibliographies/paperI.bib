abstract={Here the Human Pangenome Reference Consortium presents a first draft of the human pangenome reference. The pangenome contains 47 phased, diploid assemblies from a cohort of genetically diverse individuals1. These assemblies cover more than 99{\%} of the expected sequence in each genome and are more than 99{\%} accurate at the structural and base pair levels. Based on alignments of the assemblies, we generate a draft pangenome that captures known variants and haplotypes and reveals new alleles at structurally complex loci. We also add 119{\thinspace}million base pairs of euchromatic polymorphic sequences and 1,115 gene duplications relative to the existing reference GRCh38. Roughly 90{\thinspace}million of the additional base pairs are derived from structural variation. Using our draft pangenome to analyse short-read data reduced small variant discovery errors by 34{\%} and increased the number of structural variants detected per haplotype by 104{\%} compared with GRCh38-based workflows, which enabled the typing of the vast majority of structural variant alleles per sample.},

The format provides good compression, and the files can be efficiently loaded into in-memory data structures. We provide compression and decompression tools and libraries for using GBZ graphs, and we show that they can be efficiently used on a variety of systems.C++ and Rust implementations are available at https://github.com/jltsiren/gbwtgraph and https://github.com/jltsiren/gbwt-rs, respectively.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.}",

    abstract = "{Pangenome variation graphs model the mutual alignment of collections of DNA sequences. A set of pairwise alignments implies a variation graph, but there are no scalable methods to generate such a graph from these alignments. Existing related approaches depend on a single reference, a specific ordering of genomes or a de Bruijn model based on a fixed k-mer length. A scalable, self-contained method to build pangenome graphs without such limitations would be a key step in pangenome construction and manipulation pipelines.We design the seqwish algorithm, which builds a variation graph from a set of sequences and alignments between them. We first transform the alignment set into an implicit interval tree. To build up the variation graph, we query this tree-based representation of the alignments to reduce transitive matches into single DNA segments in a sequence graph. By recording the mapping from input sequence to output graph, we can trace the original paths through this graph, yielding a pangenome variation graph. We present an implementation that operates in external memory, using disk-backed data structures and lock-free parallel methods to drive the core graph induction step. We demonstrate that our method scales to very large graph induction problems by applying it to build pangenome graphs for several species.seqwish is published as free software under the MIT open source license.

Current advances in sequencing technologies press for the development of faster pairwise alignment algorithms that can scale with increasing read lengths and production yields.In this article, we present the wavefront alignment algorithm (WFA), an exact gap-affine algorithm that takes advantage of homologous regions between the sequences to accelerate the alignment process. As opposed to traditional dynamic programming algorithms that run in quadratic time, the WFA runs in time O(ns), proportional to the read length n and the alignment score s, using O(s2) memory. Furthermore, our algorithm exhibits simple data dependencies that can be easily vectorized, even by the automatic features of modern compilers, for different architectures, without the need to adapt the code. We evaluate the performance of our algorithm, together with other state-of-the-art implementations. As a result, we demonstrate that the WFA runs 20–300× faster than other methods aligning short Illumina-like sequences, and 10–100× faster using long noisy reads like those produced by Oxford Nanopore Technologies.The WFA algorithm is implemented within the wavefront-aligner library, and it is publicly available at https://github.com/smarco/WFA.}",

	abstract={Genome graphs can represent genetic variation and sequence uncertainty. Aligning sequences to genome graphs is key to many applications, including error correction, genome assembly, and genotyping of variants in a pangenome graph. Yet, so far, this step is often prohibitively slow. We present GraphAligner, a tool for aligning long reads to genome graphs. Compared to the state-of-the-art tools, GraphAligner is 13x faster and uses 3x less memory. When employing GraphAligner for error correction, we find it to be more than twice as accurate and over 12x faster than extant tools.Availability: Package manager: https://anaconda.org/bioconda/graphalignerand source code: https://github.com/maickrau/GraphAligner},

abstract={Pangenome references address biases of reference genomes by storing a representative set of diverse haplotypes and their alignment, usually as a graph. Alternate alleles determined by variant callers can be used to construct pangenome graphs, but advances in long-read sequencing are leading to widely available, high-quality phased assemblies. Constructing a pangenome graph directly from assemblies, as opposed to variant calls, leverages the graph's ability to represent variation at different scales. Here we present the Minigraph-Cactus pangenome pipeline, which creates pangenomes directly from whole-genome alignments, and demonstrate its ability to scale to 90 human haplotypes from the Human Pangenome Reference Consortium. The method builds graphs containing all forms of genetic variation while allowing use of current mapping and genotyping tools. We measure the effect of the quality and completeness of reference genomes used for analysis within the pangenomes and show that using the CHM13 reference from the Telomere-to-Telomere Consortium improves the accuracy of our methods. We also demonstrate construction of a Drosophila melanogaster pangenome.},
